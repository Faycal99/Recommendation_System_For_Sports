# Recommendation System for Sports

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system for workouts and diets. It combines:

Content-Based Filtering – recommends items based on user attributes (e.g., age, height, weight, fitness goals).

Collaborative Filtering – recommends items based on similarities between users and their preferences.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Workout & Diet Recommendation System
